## Ingredients
- 1 cup peanut butter, creamy or crunchy
- 1 cup date sugar
- 6 tablespoons water
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda or baking powder

## Instructions
**Preheat the oven to 350°F**. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

**Make the dough**: In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy. Stir in the water and vanilla. Next, add the flour and baking soda, mix to combine. The dough will be tough to stir, using your hands to mix it together will be easier.
Roll and flatten: Using a 1½ tablespoon scooper, scoop out the dough and roll into balls, about 1¼ inch. Place the balls of dough about 2½ inches apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern.

**Bake**: Place in the oven and bake for 10–15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes and enjoy.

**Store**: Cookies can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for 5 days. They do well loosely covered on the counter for 2–3 days as well. To keep longer, store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

**Freeze**: Let cookies cool completely, store in freezer safe container for up to 2 months.
