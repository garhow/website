## Ingredients

- 1 heaping cup blackberries (about 6 oz.)
- ½ heaping cup raspberries (about 3 oz.)
- ½ heaping cup blueberries (about 3 oz.)
- 1 heaping tablespoon chia seeds


## Directions

Add berries to a small saucepan, heat over medium stirring occasionally until softened. Using the back of a slotted spoon or fork, mash the berries along the side (or bottom) of the pan. Let mixture come to a gentle boil. The entire cooking time will be from 4 – 6 minutes. Once boiling occurs, remove from heat, add sweetener if needed and slowly add in chia seeds while stirring to combine. Fill jar and let cool a few minutes. Cover and place in the refrigerator to thicken. Store in the refrigerator. Will last up to 2 – 3 weeks (I’ve never had it longer than a week, it may even last up to a month, but if you notice any mold throw it away immediately).
