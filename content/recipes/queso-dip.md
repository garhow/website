## Ingredients
- 1 cup raw cashews
- ¾ cup water
- 1 clove garlic or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 4oz can green chile peppers
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- ½ teaspoon chili powder

## Instructions
**Soak the cashews**. I like to soak my cashews covered in hot water for 5 minutes. This helps them soften up nicely and blend into pure creamy perfect. To help with digestion, it’s recommended to soak them for 30 minutes in lukewarm water, or up to 2 hours in cool water. Soaking can be optional.

**Blend the ingredients**. Add the cashews, water, garlic, nutritional yeast, cumin, chili powder, and chile peppers to the blender cup. Blend until creamy, about 1–2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add more water as needed. Taste for flavor.

**Serve**: Serve warm or at room temperature with your favorite tortilla chips. For color and texture top with sliced or diced, jalapeno, red bell pepper, tomatoes, green onions or cilantro.

**Store**: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 6–7 days, in a covered container. Give a good stir before serving.
