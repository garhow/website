## Ingredients

- 2 cups (470 ml) vegetable broth
- ½ cup (118 ml) [buffalo hot sauce]({{< ref "buffalo-sauce" >}})
- ¼ cup (22 g) nutritional yeast 
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 2 cups (374 g) chickpeas, cooked*
- ½ medium head of cauliflower, chopped into bite-sized florets (about 2 cups; 200 g) 
- 1 cup (182 g) uncooked rice 
- 2–3 cloves garlic, minced

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Mix the vegetable broth, hot sauce, nutritional yeast, and onion powder together medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. 
2. While the liquid is heating up, pour the chickpeas a 9×13″ pan or casserole dish. Sprinkle the cauliflower and celery evenly over the chickpeas, then add the uncooked brown rice over the top of the dish.
3. Remove the vegetable broth from the heat once it comes to a boil and stir in the minced garlic. Pour the liquid evenly over the casserole dish; if any spices stick together you can gently separate them with a spatula. Cover the casserole with aluminum foil (or parchment paper, followed by aluminum foil) and bake in the middle rack of the oven for 60 minutes.
4. Remove from the oven and top with green onions and/or vegan ranch, or serve as desired. Refrigerate leftovers in a sealed container for up to one week, or in the freezer for up to one month.

## Notes
If you are using canned chickpeas, be sure to drain and rinse them well. You can also replace them with any other bean of your choosing!
