Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is *the* ~~spiritual~~ sucessor to [Jet Set Radio](../jet-set-radio). Alongside the incredible soundtrack and the bizarre (but good) story, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk expands upon the gameplay of the Jet Set games and I honestly believe that it surpasses the games that came before it. You need to play this game.
