## Online Multiplayer

Although the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (WFC) service shut down in 2014, you can still play this game online! There are pretty large communities on Discord and Reddit that still actively play this game using [Wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de/), a free replacement service for the WFC.

## Modding

There are countless mods and track packs for Mario Kart Wii. You can find extensive information about the topic at the [Custom Mario Kart Wiiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Main_Page), a community wiki dedicated to modding the game.

### CTGP Revolution

[CTGP Revolution](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/) is a mod for Mario Kart Wii that adds 200+ tracks and countless extra features. The mod is easy to install, and the tracklist rotates every few months, keeping things fresh with each update. This is my favorite way to play the game, just because of the variety that the community-made tracks brings to the game. You can also easily import your own assets such as character reskins and custom track music!

### Wiimms Mario Kart Fun

[Wiimms Mario Kart Fun](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_Mario_Kart_Fun) is a custom track distribution by Wiimm, the creator of Wiimmfi and a prominent modder. This is another great mod and is easy to install using the custom ISO patcher.

### Mario Kart Wii Deluxe

[Mario Kart Wii Deluxe](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii_Deluxe) is a custom track distribution by FJRoyet. It adds every retro track in the series to the game, alongside phenomenal custom tracks, adding up to over 600 tracks total, making this one of the biggest mods in the game's history.
