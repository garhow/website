title: My game collection

I've been playing video games since a very early age, either three or four. My first video game system was either the Nintendo DSi or the Nintendo Wii, I can't remember... but regardless, video games have meant so much to me ever since.

This isn't everything, my Genesis, NES, and Wii U games are in a bin somewhere, but these are some of my favorite games that I own.
