## Online Multiplayer

Although Xbox Live for Halo 2 shut down over a decade ago, you can still play Halo 2 online! This is done by using the System Link mode over the internet with a tool called [XLink Kai](https://www.teamxlink.co.uk/) which you can easily setup on any computer. I'm running it on a Raspberry Pi 5 with Debian 12 and it works flawlessly. However, it can be hard to find players using the service! You can find most players in the Latin America region, so be sure to look for that in the XLink web dashboard.
