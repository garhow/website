## Campaign

### #1 The Heretic

"For failure such as this, no punishment is too great"

This is the opening cutscene, featuring a Covenant council hearing where a Covenant commander is punished for failing to defeat "the Demon," Master Chief.

### #2 Armory

This is the tutorial that teaches the player how to look and move.

### #3 Cairo Station

This is the first real level in Halo 2's campaign. You defend a military outpost called Cairo Station from boarding Covenant troops. Around the middle of the level, Cortana warns you of a bomb that the Covanent placed on the station. At the end of the level, you find the bomb and watch a cutscene where Master Chief launches the bomb at a Covenant ship. Watching this cutscene for the first time felt unreal. It's insane to me that this could run on the Xbox.

### #4 Outskirts

This is the first level on Earth, where you defend a city from a Covenant invasion and rescue marines.

## Online Multiplayer

Although Xbox Live for Halo 2 shut down over a decade ago, you can still play Halo 2 online! This is done by using the System Link mode over the internet with a tool called [XLink Kai](https://www.teamxlink.co.uk/) which you can easily setup on any computer. I'm running it on a Raspberry Pi 5 with Debian 12 and it works flawlessly. However, it can be hard to find players using the service! You can find most players in the Latin America region, so be sure to look for that in the XLink web dashboard.
