During the Game Awards 2023, SEGA announced the development of five new games, all from (mostly) dormant franchises: Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage!

## JET SET RADIOOOO!!

SEGA finally announced a new Jet Set Radio and it looks amazing!! The new parkour mechanics look extremely fun to use and the new graphcis and character designs look great. Hopefully it will be as good as [Bomb Rush Cyberfunk]({{< ref "bomb-rush-cyberfunk" >}})!! GOTY if the [Funky Uncle](https://twitter.com/Hideki_Naganuma) returns.

## Crazy Taxi

As long as they can get the rights to use The Offspring's music, this game is gonna slap. I've only played the first Crazy Taxi, so I don't know what the second and third games added, but the driving mechanics seem totally different in the new game, but it looks great regardless.

## Shinobi

I don't know much about Shinobi, so there's not much I can say about it, but the art style looks phenomenal. Definitely picking this up when it releases.

I don't know anything at all about Streets of Rage and Golden Axe, but they also look pretty cool. This announcement was honestly mind-blowing, mostly because SEGA has refused to make anything but Persona, Sonic, and Yakuza games for the past twenty years. I'm mostly excited for Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi though...
