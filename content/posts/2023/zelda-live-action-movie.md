title: "A live-action Zelda movie was just announced"
---

### Seriously.

Yesterday, Nintendo announced in a [press release](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2023/231108.html) that a live-action movie based on the Legend of Zelda franchise was in development. *Live action.* Although most Zelda fans would definitely prefer an animated movie in a cel-shaded style or even a Ghibli-inspired style, a live-action Zelda movie doesn't sound that bad on paper...

The announcement also shared the fact that [Avi Arad](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0032696/) will be the producer for this movie. He was also the producer for Morbius and Uncharted. Great.

Also, the film is being co-financed by Sony Pictures. I just found that a little funny.

Well... people thought the Mario movie was going to be a disaster, so hopefully this one will turn out good as well.
